Project Description:
Developed a simple android app that states if it is recommended to buy cryptocurrency or not for the choice entered by the user on the app. Cryptodata is fetched from a third party API
called https://www.coinlore.com/cryptocurrency-data-api. This is passed to the web service which contains the logic to determine if the user can buy or not. The fetched data is also stored in MongoDB for analytics purposes.
Analytics Dashboard displays user and usage statistics.
